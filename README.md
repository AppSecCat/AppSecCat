- 👋 Hi, I’m @AppSecCat
- 👀 I’m interested in next generation payment, open banking and other FinTech inovations that push the envelope of viability while ensuring that nobody is left behind.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various development and operating security patterns that enable hybrid cloud native service mesh benefits all the way to the edge.   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an open source "agreement life-cycle management" , "agreement driven orchestration" and "Next-Gen Authorization & Configuration Engine" for "high assurance" mash-ups of embedded banking and white-label prooducts and services.
- 📫 How to reach me ... will be posting new contact details shortly for pre - lauch
